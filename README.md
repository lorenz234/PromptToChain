# Prompt To Chain - ETH Global Hackathon Istanbul 2023
Blockchain Backend Solution to Showcase an AI Verification System to Combat Fake News

“Prompt to Chain” showcases a blockchain-backed solution for verifying AI-generated content on Scroll. Only after an NFT representation of the input prompt is generated on the blockchain, will the AI start generating an AI image. This ensures that no AI image can be generated without an equivalent, tracked NFT on the blockchain. The NFT metadata is then updated by the smart contract owner to prove the origin as an image created by AI.

This platform demonstrates how blockchain and AI can synergistically protect users from unverified AI-generated images. Using an open ledger, it allows anyone to verify if, who, and when an AI image was generated. Through this project, I aim to inspire LLM developers to incorporate blockchain solutions as safeguards against the misuse of AI in creating fake news.
